# hello-world
I used to be a field service technician and I was great at helping people get their electronic things back up and running. I have always loved building things. I have a very technical mindset and so I like to be challenged and solve problems. I went to Centriq and learned how to build websites and I love all the different opportunities and variety I can have working in the digital world. I was always the nerd in the family so it was a natural fit for me to want to start building websites.
 I have always wondered how programming worked and now that I know I am eager to put my new skills to work. I consider myself a lifetime learner. Back when I got my first trade school certificate they told us that in the technical world you are always learning. I think that is still true today and I love learning new things. Its empowering and exciting and it opens doors that I never new existed. This is why I want to develop .Net. The possibilities are endless and the people I meet in the IT field are amazing.
